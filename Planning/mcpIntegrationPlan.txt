AI Agent/MCP Server Integration for thefrogpit
===============================================

Overview:
---------
You uploaded your frog-api Flask app, and asked about how to incorporate AI Agent/MCP Server frameworks into your system, starting from that base.

You later shared the MCP repository:
https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers

You mentioned your second ThinkCentre (new node) is arriving, and asked about setting up full AI Agent orchestration across your servers, without affecting the main server's performance.

---

Summary of Current Setup:
--------------------------
Main Server (thefrogpit):
  - Hosts: WordPress (averyizatt.com), Plex, Frog Tank API (Flask), Dashboard
  - Mission-critical services

New Server (thebrain - incoming ThinkCentre):
  - Will host AI Agent Orchestration
  - No effect on main server's core performance

---

Bigger Vision:
--------------
- Turn your home server into a modular **AI-agent-managed system**.
- Use frameworks like **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**, or **OpenDevin** for real MCP Server functionality.
- Your frog-api fits naturally as an agent input.

---

Integration Plan:
=================

Phase 1: Prep New ThinkCentre (1 day)
-------------------------------------
- Fresh Ubuntu Server 22.04 install
- Set Hostname:
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname thebrain
- Install Essentials:
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install python3-pip git docker.io docker-compose htop curl nginx -y
- Setup SSH keys for easy management.

Phase 2: Deploy Agent Control Server (AutoGen/CrewAI) (1-2 days)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Clone and install AutoGen:
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git
    cd autogen
    pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run basic MCP server:
    python3 -m autogen.server
- (Optional) Reverse proxy AutoGen server via Nginx for easy access.

Phase 3: Create First Agents (2-3 days)
---------------------------------------
- Frog Tank Monitor Agent (poll temp/humidity and alert)
- Service Health Monitor Agent (Nginx, Plex, etc.)
- Backup Verifier Agent (check daily backups)
- Security Watchdog Agent (logins anomaly detection)

Phase 4: Orchestrate Agents (2 days)
------------------------------------
- Chain agents to work together automatically.
- Example: Service Down -> Check Logs -> Try Restart -> Alert if fail.

Phase 5: Dashboard + Admin (1-2 days)
-------------------------------------
- Add Homer tiles for agent statuses.
- Build simple agent health UI.

Phase 6: Future Expansion (later)
---------------------------------
- Add LLM agents for troubleshooting.
- Integrate voice-controlled Jarvis system.
- Predict failures and auto-tune servers.

Architecture Overview:
=======================

    [ESP32 Sensors]   [System Logs]    [App Status]    [Web Traffic]  
            \             |                |               /
             \            |                |              /
             [AutoGen MCP Server] -- [Orchestrates All Agents]
                          |
                    [NTFY Alerts]
                          |
                  [User Dashboard (Frog, Plex, Admin)]

---

Practical Framework Choices:
=============================
- AutoGen (Microsoft) - Production-grade multi-agent system.
- CrewAI - Lightweight agent team orchestration.
- OpenDevin - For server/DevOps task automation.

---

Next Steps (Optional):
======================
- Build a starter repo (folders like `/agents`, `/config`, `/scripts`).
- Create the first agent (Service Uptime Checker for Nginx/Plex).
- Future: build full dashboard integration into Homer.

---

Conclusion:
===========
✅ Your current frog-api fits perfectly into a bigger MCP system.
✅ Using a second ThinkCentre ("thebrain") avoids impacting your main services.
✅ You can evolve gradually into full home-lab-scale AI agent management.

Ready to help build:
- Starter repo
- First example agent
- Or both!
